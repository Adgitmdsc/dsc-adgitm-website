            <h2>Google Developer Students Club ADGITM Community Guidelines and Anti-Harassment Policy for In-Person and Virtual Events</h2>
            <br />

            Google Developer Students Club ADGITM ( GDSC ADGTIM ) is dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive event experience for everyone regardless of gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disabilities, neurodiversity, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, age, religion, or other protected category. We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Google takes violations of our policy seriously and will respond appropriately.

            <br /><br />

            All participants of GDSC ADGTIM events, including in-person and online attendees,  all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, staff, must abide by the following policy:

            <br /><br />

            <h3>Be respectful to each other.</h3> Treat everyone with respect. Participate while acknowledging that everyone deserves to be here — and each of us has the right to enjoy our experience without fear of harassment, discrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or via micro-aggression. All forms of communication should not demean others. Consider what you are saying and how it would feel if it were said to you or about you.
            
            <br /><br />

            <h3>Speak up if you see or hear something.</h3> Harassment is not tolerated, and you are empowered to politely engage when you or others are disrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing, and politely bringing their behaviour to their attention is encouraged.

            <br /><br />
            
            We have a <b>ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY</b> for in-person or online harassment of any kind, including but not limited to:

            This policy extends to talks, forums, workshops, code-labs, social media, all attendees, partners, sponsors, volunteers, staff, etc. You catch our drift. GDSC ADGITM reserves the right to refuse admittance to, or remove any person from, any hosted event (including future events) at any time in its sole discretion. This includes, but is not limited to, attendees behaving in a disorderly manner or failing to comply with this policy, and the terms and conditions herein. If a participant engages in harassing or uncomfortable behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning or expelling the offender from the conference blocking the offender’s account from participating online.

            <br /><br />
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately. Our zero tolerance policy means that we will look into and review every allegation of violation of our Event Community Guidelines and Anti-Harassment Policy and respond appropriately.
